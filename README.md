# WISHMail

**Certified mail for agents, on Hedera.**

WISHMail is a convention for sealed envelopes carried inside HCS-10 message operations, together with a certified layer — resolution proof, postmark, return receipt, attempted-delivery slip — such that any party can reconstruct a correspondence from public consensus data alone and appraise what each proof rests on.

It sells two claims, separately.

**Origin.** A stamped envelope is welded to its settlement event and to the witnessed resolution of its address. An envelope that was misresolved or mis-settled does not open.

**Story.** A correspondence is a chain of proofs on public topics, replayable by anyone from the specification alone — with no key, no stamp, no account, no credential, and no broker.

ETHOnline 2026 submission. Specification 0.5.2; frozen at 0.5.0 on 2026-09-07, patched to 0.5.1 the same day (D-135 – D-138) and to 0.5.2 on 2026-09-08 (D-145 – D-148). Wire strings carry `0.5`. Deployed on `hedera:testnet` and no other ledger.

## What it is not

WISHMail defines no transport — HCS-10 does, and WISHMail defines only what rides inside it. It operates no registry; registries are external, read-only, and plural, and WISHMail never adjudicates between them. It claims no forward secrecy. It delivers nothing to a recipient's hand: consensus witnesses, recipients read, and there is no push or notification surface. It carries no broadcast — a stamp buys one envelope to one address. And it does not certify unstamped HCS-10 messaging, or make any claim about it.

## The six tools

```
resolve      an address -> coordinates and a resolution proof, under a named profile
buy_stamp    stamps from the Postmaster, in USDC over x402 or in HBAR
send         one sealed envelope to one resolved address
inbox        read your own lanes; open what binds
ack          acknowledge an envelope that opened: produce its return receipt
verify       reconcile a correspondence from consensus alone — free, forever
```

## The shape of it

```
   registries --resolve--> Assembler --binds--> sealed envelope, signed by the sender
   (read-only)             (the sender's)               |
                                                        | the Postmaster carries
                                                        | (pays; attests nothing)
                                                        v
   Verifier <--public data-- Consensus <--------------- lane (HCS-10 connection topic)
   reconciles               witnesses: postmark         |
   (replay + lookup)                                    v
                                                 recipient opens (AAD verifies)
                                                 recipient acknowledges (return receipt)
```

No actor performs another's verb. The Assembler binds, Consensus witnesses, the Verifier reconciles, the Postmaster carries. That grammar is the separation of powers the whole design rests on.

## The repository

```
spec/           WISHMAIL_SPEC_v0_5.md — the only normative document
                CONFORMANCE_TESTS_v0_5.md — the working ledger; nothing in it is normative
                schemas/  fourteen JSON Schemas, one per data object
                vectors/  aad.json, seal.json — the court for T-P1-4 and T-P1-5
                pins.json the machine-readable form of the pinned standards
                adr/      one architecture decision record per decision, D-1 onward
conformance/    the suite: one test per T-<P-ID>-<n>, keyed to the invariant it serves
app/            the reference implementation: MCP server, WebMCP page, SDK, CLI, resolvers
recon/          dated fetches of the standards, and the pins drafted from them

## Conformance

Four classes, on one floor.

```
        +---------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+
        | CORRESPONDENT |   |  RECIPIENT  |   | POSTMASTER  |
        +-------+-------+   +------+------+   +------+------+
                |                  |           =======+=======  the pedestal:
                |                  |                  |         issues the stamp
        +-------+------------------+------------------+-------+
        |                       VERIFIER                      |
        |             the floor: every class verifies         |
        +-----------------------------------------------------+
```

VERIFIER conformance is achievable with no private broker, API key, credit, Hedera account, stamp, or recipient key configured. That is not a courtesy; it is the point. A mirror node is a read interface, not a broker, and evidence never depends on which one you read.

Seventeen invariants (P-1 – P-17), eighty-three conformance tests, and no MUST without a test. A conformance claim names the classes, profiles, and pins it was measured against; silence claims nothing.

## Status

The specification is frozen and the build is beginning. No conformance claim is valid yet: the `$POSTAGE` token and treasury are unpinned and the schemas are unregistered, and the suite refuses to produce a report while any pin in `spec/pins.json` is unfilled.
